# Fancy Elytras

Fancy Elytras is a Minecraft project for version 1.21.2+ that enables custom elytra designs using custom trims rather than core shaders.

## Custom Elytra Textures

To apply a custom elytra texture, replace the default texture file with your own design. **Do not rename the texture file** unless you know what you are doing, as incorrect naming may cause issues with the texture loading correctly.

## How to get the Custom Elytras

To get a custom elytra with your design, use the following command:

/give @s elytra[minecraft:trim={material:"minecraft:bedrock",pattern:"minecraft:elytra1"}]

Change 'elytra1' to 'elytra2' or higher (or whatever you named the trims).
## Extra info.

I've added 15 on this template, feel free to add (or remove) more if needed.

## Known Limitations

1. Ensure your texture fully covers the elytra texture; incomplete coverage may cause the normal elytra texture to stick out.
2. Assign each new trim to a unique item. Assigning the same item to multiple trims can result in error.
