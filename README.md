# Fancy Elytras

Fancy Elytras is a Minecraft project for version 1.21.2+ that enables custom elytra designs using trims rather than core shaders.

## Custom Elytra Textures

To apply a custom elytra texture, replace the default texture file with your own design. **Do not rename the texture file** unless you know what you are doing, as incorrect naming may cause issues with the texture loading correctly.

## How to get the Custom Elytras

To equip a custom elytra with your design, use the following command:

/give @s elytra[minecraft:trim={material:"minecraft:bedrock",pattern:"minecraft:elytra1"}]
